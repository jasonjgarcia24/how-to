    "### <a id=\"Create-Repo\">1. Create Remote Repository on GitHub:</a>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    " - Got to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">github.com</a>\n",
    " - In the 'Repositories panel, select `New`.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewRepo-GitHub.png\" title=\"github.com\" /><br>\n",
    " - Fill out the repo name and description.\n",
    " - Check `Add a README file` and if needed `Add .gitignore`.\n",
    "     - A '.gitignore' file allows you to populate filenames and file extensions that you do not wish to be included in your commits to the repository.\n",
    "     - A common use for this file is to prevent config files that have api keys or passwords stored in them from making their way into your repository.\n",
    "     -'.gitignore' files come prepopulated with certain files and extension names specific to your programming language, but can be customized to fit your needs.\n",
    " - Apply the settings shown in the below image for a standard public repo and click `Create repository`.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewRepoSettings-GitHub.png\" title=\"Create a new repository\" /><br>\n",
    " - Now you should have a blank repo.<br>\n",

    "### <a id=\"Clone-Repo\">2. Clone Repository Locally with SSH:</a>\n",
    " - Copy your GitHub address for SSH cloning.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"images\\GetAddressForClone-GitHub.png\" title=\"GitHub address for SSH cloning\" /><br>\n",
    " - In Bash type `git clone <address>`\n",
    "     - In this case, `<address>` is 'git@github.com:jasonjgarcia24/fintech-challenges.git')\n",
    "     - If the note \"The authenticity of host 'github.com'... can't be established.... Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\", type `yes`.\n",
    " - Now you have your local repository and can apply changes as needed locally only.<br>\n",

    "### <a id=\"Commit-Push-Changes-to-GitHub\">3. Commit and Push Repository Changes to GitHub:</a>\n",
    " - In Bash type `cd fintech-challenges` to enter into the 'fintech-challenges' repository.\n",
    " - Apply changes to the repo as necessary.\n",
    " - In Bash type `git add -A` to stage the changes to the Git repository.\n",
    "     - This is telling the Git application to add any changes to the staging area, and the `-A` means I want to add all the files in this repository.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\AddChangesRepo-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Add changes to the staging area\" /><br>\n",
    " - In Bash type `git commit -m \"<message>\"` to commit changes to your remote git. Now you're ready to push the changes.\n",
    "     - In this case, `<message>` is 'First commit of challenge 01.')\n",
    "     - Use `-m <message>` to type in a commit message. This message is a descriptive message to document a description of the changes.\n",
    " - In Bash type `git push origin main` to push changes to the 'main' GitHub branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\PushChangesRepo-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Push changes to GitHub\" /><br>\n",
    " - You can now go to your remote repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">github.com</a>, hit refresh, and view the updated repository with the changes applied.<br>\n",

    "### <a id=\"Commit-To-Alt-Branch\">4. Commit to Alternative Branch on GitHub:</a>\n",
    " - In Bash type `git checkout -b <new branch name>`.\n",
    "     - The -b means that you will create a new branch that doesn't already exist.\n",
    "     - In this case, `<new branch name>` will be '01-challenge'.\n",
    "     - Notice also that the branch name in Bash will change from '(main)' to '(01-challenge)'.\n",
    " - Apply changes to the repo as necessary.\n",
    " - In Bash type `git add -A` to stage the changes to the Git repository.\n",
    "     - This is telling the Git application to add any changes to the staging area, and the `-A` means I want to add all the files in this repository.<br>\n",
    " - In Bash type `git commit -m \"<message>\"` to commit changes to your remote git. Now you're ready to push the changes.\n",
    "     - In this case, `<message>` is 'First commit of challenge 01.')\n",
    "     - Use `-m <message>` to type in a commit message. This message is a descriptive message to document a description of the changes.\n",
    " - In Bash type `git push origin 01-challenge` to push changes to the '01-challenge' GitHub branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\SuccessfulPushToAltBranch-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Push changes to GitHub\" /><br>\n",
    " - You can now go to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">github.com</a> and hit refresh. You'll notice the 'main' repository has not been updated but that there is now an additional branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewBranch-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Updated GitHub branch\" /><br>\n",
    " - In the dropdown menu next to the number of branches, switch to your new branch (in this case '1-challenge').\n",
    " - In the '01-challenge' branch page, click on `Compare & pull request`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewBranchPage-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"New GitHub branch page\" /><br>\n",
    " - Now you've opened a new \"pull request\" page.\n",
    "     - Notice the comment for this branch is the same as what was entered in the Bash window with the `git commit -m \"<message>\"` command.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewBranchPullRequest-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"New GitHub branch page\" /><br>\n",
    " - Click `Create pull request`.\n",
    " - Since this repo is all yours, you can just merge this pull request right into 'main' by clicking `Merge pull request` and then `Confirm merge`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\NewBranchMerge-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Merge new GitHub branch\" /><br>\n",
    " - You should now see some form of the message 'Pull request successfully merged and closed'. You can now leave the branch or delete it, it's your preference.\n",
    " - Navigate back to the repo's homepage and you can see your alternative branches merged file(s) have been added to the 'main' branch.<br>\n",

    " - Go to the homepage of your GitHub repo.\n",
    " - Select the commits link to open the full commit history (boxed in yellow below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"images\\RepoCommits-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Repo homepage\"/><br>\n",
    " - If previous commits have been pushed to GitHub, you will now see them organized by date.\n",

    " - For this practice we will be pulling the 'Initial commit' at the bottom of the screen. To do this, click on the `clipboard icon` of the specific commit that you plan to access. This will copy the full hash to your clipboard.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"images\\RepoCommitHistory-GitHub-Windows.png\" title=\"Repo commit history\"/><br>\n",
    " - In bash type `git checkout <commit hash>` to checkout the specific commit.\n",
    "     - You will then see the branch change from (`<current branch>`) to ((`<hash#...>`)). In this case, `<current branch>` is 'main' and `<hash#...>` is the first seven digits of the hash, which is 'e106071...'.\n",
