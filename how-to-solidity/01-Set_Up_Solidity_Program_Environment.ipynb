    "Most of the stuff that we need to write the client-side DApps is going to be JavaScript, which can be written in any environment (same as Solidity).<br><br>\n",
    "What needs to be installed is the **truffle test server**. This will be both the be the test server, but it also includes a number of tools that are going to compile the Solidity applications.<br>\n",
    ">Note: Smart contracts do not get compiled on the Ethereum blockchain network. They're already compiled bytecode when they exist within the blockchain.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll only migrate the compiled smart contract(s), and Truffle is a great tool for this. In addition, Truffle has a built-in test server.<br><br>\n",
    "We'll also go over installing Ganache. Ganache works side-by-side Truffle. It's optional to use because we have a test server that runs with Truffle. But if wanted, Ganache does provide a nice visual interface. So, it's basically just an Ethereum test server that you can run with a special GUI that you can use to see what's going on and see how much ETH is at different addresses. Ganache also allows you to easily visually browse the transactions that are happening."
